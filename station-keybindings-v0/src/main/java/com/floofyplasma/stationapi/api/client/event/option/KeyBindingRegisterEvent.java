 * Used to add keybindings to the keybinding screen.
 * Implement this in the class you plan to use to add your keybindings, and then override registerKeyBindings(List{@literal <KeyBinding>} keyBindings).
 * You then want to add your instantiated keybindings into the list using keyBindings.add(myKeybind).
 * All events need to be registered in your mod's preInit method using KeyBindingRegister.EVENT.register(yourInstantiatedClass).
 * <p>
 * You also likely want to use the KeyPressed event to handle your keybindings.
